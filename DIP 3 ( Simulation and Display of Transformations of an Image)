 Experiment Title: Simulation and Display of Transformations of an Image.
 AIM: To study the distinct transformations of an Image.
 OBJECTIVE: To study the Image Processing concept.
 TOOLSREQUIRED:MATLAB
 THEORY:Resizing refers to the scaling of an image. When an image is resized, the pixel
 information changes, and hence, reducing the size of an image requires resampling of the
 pixels while increasing the size of an image requires reconstruction of the image.
 Reconstruction means we need to interpolate new pixels. We can manually specify the
 scaling size of an image, or we can use the scaling factor.
 Scaling of an image in MATLAB can also be accomplished using different interpolation
 methods. Image interpolation occurs on resizing or distorting the image from a one-pixel grid
 to another.
 Whydoweneed to resize images?
 1. Image resizing is necessary to increase or decrease the total number of pixels.
 2. Resizing the image is a critical pre-processing step in computer vision processes. Machine
 learning models train substantially faster on smaller images.
 3. Resizing is essential to prevent the loss of information.
 4. Smaller images consume lesser size on network and GPU.
 5. It is often used to discard the unnecessary information.
 Program Code:
 %Scaling & Rotation
 %Scaling (Resize)
 I=imread('earcell.jpg');
 subplot(2,2,1); subimage(I); title('Original Image');
 s=input('Enter Scaling Factor');
 j=imresize(I,s);
 subplot(2,2,2); subimage(j); title('Scaled Image');
 %Rotation
 K=imrotate(j,60);
subplot(2,2,3); imshow(K); title('Rotated Image 60deg');
 R=imrotate(j,45);
 subplot(2,2,4); imshow(R); title('Rotated Image 45deg');
 %Display the color image and its Resized images by different methods
 %Display the color image

 %Display Resized image by Bilinear method
 B=imresize(I,5);
 subplot(2,2,2);
 subimage(B);
 title('Bilinear Image');
 %Display Resized image by Nearest method
 C=imresize(I,5,'nearest');
 subplot(2,2,3);
 subimage(C);
 title('Nearest Image');
 %Display Resized image by Bicubic method
 D=imresize(I,5,'Bicubic');
