Experiment No. 5 
EXPERIMENT TITLE: Simulation and Display of bit planes of an Image.  
AIM: To study the bit planes of an Image.  
OBJECTIVE: To study the Image Processing concept.  
TOOLS REQUIRED: MATLAB 
THEORY: Image is mainly grouping of pixels (dots) information. When we write that image is of 
600 X 400 sizes, it means that image has 600 pixels in horizontal direction and 400 pixels in vertical 
direction. So, altogether there are 600 X 400 pixels and each pixel contains some information about 
image. Pixel of grayscale image has a value lies in between 0 – 255 (Total 256 or 28 Levels) which 
decides at which position, if pixel value is 0, it means that pixel colour will be fully black and if pixel 
value is 255, then that pixel will be fully white and pixel having intermediate value will be having 
shades of black and white. Since pixel value of grayscale image lies between 0 -255, so its 
information is contained using 8 bit So, we can divide those image into 8 planes (8 Binary Image). 
Binary image are those images whose pixel value can be either 0 or 1. For an 8-bit image “0” is 
encoded in 00000000 and “255” is encoded in 11111111. 
PROGRAM CODE:  
i = imread('exp.png'); % Read the image 
i = rgb2gray(i); % Convert to grayscale if needed (only if the image is not grayscale) 
b0 = double(bitget(i, 1));  
b1 = double(bitget(i, 2));  
b2 = double(bitget(i, 3));  
b3 = double(bitget(i, 4));  
b4 = double(bitget(i, 5));  
b5 = double(bitget(i, 6));  
b6 = double(bitget(i, 7));  
b7 = double(bitget(i, 8));  
subplot(3, 3, 1); imshow(i, []); title('Original Image'); 
subplot(3, 3, 2); imshow(b0, []); title('BIT PLANE 0');  
subplot(3, 3, 3); imshow(b1, []); title('BIT PLANE 1');  
subplot(3, 3, 4); imshow(b2, []); title('BIT PLANE 2');  
subplot(3, 3, 5); imshow(b3, []); title('BIT PLANE 3');  
subplot(3, 3, 6); imshow(b4, []); title('BIT PLANE 4');  
subplot(3, 3, 7); imshow(b5, []); title('BIT PLANE 5');  
subplot(3, 3, 8); imshow(b6, []); title('BIT PLANE 6');  
subplot(3, 3, 9); imshow(b7, []); title('BIT PLANE 7');

CONCLUSION: We have studied bit planes of an Image.
