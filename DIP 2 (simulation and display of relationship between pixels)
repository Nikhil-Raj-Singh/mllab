 Experiment Title: Simulation and Display of Relationships between Pixels
 AIM: To study the relationships between Pixels in an Image.
 OBJECTIVE: To study the Image Processing concept.
 TOOLSREQUIRED:MATLAB
 THEORY:Digital images play an important role both in daily life applications as well as in
 the areas of research technology. The digital image processing refers to the manipulation of
 an image by means of processor. The different elements of an image processing system
 include image acquisition, image storage, image processing and display.
 An image is two dimensional function that represent a message of sum characteristics such as
 brightness or color of the viewed scene in the first Matlab program. The program for determining
 the relationship between pixels has been implemented.
 Neighbors of a pixel
 Apixel p at (x,y) has 4-horizontal/vertical neighbors at (x+1,y), (x-1,y), (x,y+1) and (x,y-1).
 These are called the 4-neighbors of p : N4(p).
 Apixel p at (x,y) has 4 diagonal neighbors at (x+1,y+1), (x+1,y-1), (x-1,y+1) and (x-1,y-1).
 These are called the diagonal-neighbours of p : ND(p).
 The 4-neighbours and the diagonal neighbours of p are called 8-neighbours of p : N8(p).
 Adjacency between pixels
 Let V be the set of intensity values used to define adjacency.
 In a binary image, V ={1} if we are referring to adjacency of pixels with value 1. In a gray
scale image, the idea is the same, but set V typically contains more elements.
 For example, in the adjacency of pixels with a range of possible intensity values 0 to 255, set
 Vcould be any subset of these 256 values.
 Weconsider three types of adjacency:
 a) 4-adjacency: Two pixels p and q with values from V are 4-adjacent if q is in the set N4(p).
 b) 8-adjacency: Two pixels p and q with values from V are 8-adjacent if q is in the set
 N8(p).
c) m-adjacency(mixed adjacency): Two pixels p and q with values from V are m-adjacent if
 1. q is in N4(p), or
 2. 2) q is in ND(p) and the set N4(p)∩N4(q) has no pixels whose values are from V.
 Connectivity between pixels
 It is an important concept in digital image processing.
 It is used for establishing boundaries of objects and components of regions in an image.
 Two pixels are said to be connected:
 • if they are adjacent in some sense(neighbour pixels,4/8/m-adjacency)
 • if their gray levels satisfy a specified criterion of similarity(equal intensity level)
 There are three types of connectivity on the basis of adjacency. They are:
 a) 4-connectivity: Two or more pixels are said to be 4-connected if they are 4-adjacent with
 each others.
 b) 8-connectivity: Two or more pixels are said to be 8-connected if they are 8-adjacent with
 each others.
 c) m-connectivity: Two or more pixels are said to be m-connected if they are m-adjacent with
 each others.
 Program Code:
 %Tofind Neighbour of a given Pixel
 a=magic(5);
 disp(‘a=’); disp(a);
 b=input('Enter the row < size of the Matrix');
 c=input(' Enter the Column < size of matrix');
 disp(‘Element’); disp(a(b,c));
 %4Point Neighbour
 N4=[a(b+1,c), a(b-1,c), a(b,c+1), a(b,c-1)];
 disp(‘N4=’); disp(N4);
 %8Point Neighbour
 N8=[a(b+1,c), a(b-1,c), a(b,c+1), a(b,c-1), a(b+1,c+1), a(b+1,c-1), a(b-1,c-1), a(b-1,c+1)];
 disp(‘N8=’); disp(N8);
 %Diagonal Neighbour
ND=[a(b+1,c+1),a(b+1,c-1),a(b-1,c-1),a(b-1,c+1)];
 disp(‘ND=’);disp(ND);
